It is one of the most powerful and sinister spells known to Wizardkind. When cast successfully the curse inflicts intense, excruciating pain on the victim.

This, in turn, would reduce the victim's capacity for independent thought and make them more receptive to outside influence."

The Killing Curse is known to be unblockable, as once it strikes the living victim, it almost always results in immediate death. There is no counter-curse since it is not possible to revive the dead.
