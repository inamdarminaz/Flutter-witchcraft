          "An emerald green potion used in a stone basin in which the locket Horcrux was hidden. Its consumption causes the drinker to see terrible things, dehydrate, and experience excruciating burning in one's insides. Because of the 'terrible things' it subjects its victim to, it has an effect similar to the presence of a Dementor."

      "description":
          "A potion noted by Lord Voldemort to be an old piece of Dark Magic. Its ingredients include a bone from the father unknowingly given, flesh from the servant willingly given, and blood from an enemy of the one for whom it is intended. It creates a new body for a Dark witch or wizard who has used Horcruxes and lost their original body, as Voldemort did. This new body is a replica of the old one and has its former powers too. It apparently requires that the Dark wizard exist within a rudimentary body that can be placed within the cauldron after all the ingredients are added. If the blood of the enemy contains protections or infections, like a love sacrifice or lycanthrophy, it will also affect or protect the wizard or witch reborn with it."
